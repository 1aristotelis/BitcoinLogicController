# Bitcoin Logic Controller (BLC)

A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) plays a crucial role in an industrial control system. It is a specialized computerized device designed for industrial automation and control applications.
As sensors and actuators gain more & more intelligence (Internet of things IOT, smart devices), the industry is moving past the PLC as a central process controller and toward distributed process controllers (evolution from IEC61131 cyclic systems to IEC61499 event-based systems). We posit that **the next step of industrial automation will deport the logic and process control from the physical layer (devices) to the network layer (Bitcoin)**. 

The PLC's primary function is to monitor inputs from various sensors and control outputs to actuator devices, enabling it to manage and regulate industrial processes. Here are the key roles of a PLC in an industrial control system:

1. Input/Output Control: The PLC receives input signals from sensors and other field devices, such as switches, transmitters, and detectors. These inputs provide information about the state of the process, such as temperature, pressure, level, and position. The PLC continuously scans and monitors these input signals to determine the current state of the system.

2. Logic Control: The PLC contains a programmable logic controller that executes a user-defined control program. The control program consists of a set of instructions written in a programming language specifically designed for PLCs, such as ladder logic or structured text. These instructions implement logical operations, arithmetic calculations, timers, counters, and other control algorithms to determine the desired system behavior.

3. Decision Making: Based on the inputs received and the control program's logic, the PLC makes decisions and determines the appropriate control actions. It evaluates the current process conditions, compares them with predefined setpoints and conditions, and determines whether to activate specific outputs or perform certain actions. The PLC's decision-making capability allows it to implement complex control strategies and respond to changing process conditions in real-time.

4. Output Control: Once the PLC has made decisions based on the control program's logic, it sends output signals to actuator devices such as valves, motors, pumps, and solenoids. These outputs control the physical elements of the industrial process, regulating variables such as flow rate, pressure, temperature, and position. The PLC ensures that the appropriate control actions are taken by activating or deactivating the output devices based on the desired system behavior.

5. Communication: The PLC facilitates communication with other devices and systems in the industrial control network. It can exchange data with supervisory systems, human-machine interfaces (HMIs), remote input/output modules, and other PLCs. This communication enables higher-level control, data monitoring, and coordination within the overall control system architecture.

6. Reliability and Safety: PLCs are designed to operate in demanding industrial environments and provide high levels of reliability and safety. They often incorporate features such as fault detection, error handling, redundancy, and fail-safe mechanisms. These features help ensure the system's continuous operation, minimize downtime, and prevent hazardous situations in critical industrial processes.

7. Scalability and Flexibility: PLCs offer scalability and flexibility, allowing the control system to adapt to changing process requirements. They can handle small-scale to large-scale applications, and their modular design allows for easy expansion and customization. PLCs can be programmed and reprogrammed to accommodate modifications in the control strategy or to integrate new equipment into the industrial process.

Overall, the PLC serves as the central control device in an industrial control system, responsible for acquiring data, executing control programs, making decisions, and controlling the physical elements of the process. Its role is critical in achieving efficient and reliable automation of industrial processes across various industries.
